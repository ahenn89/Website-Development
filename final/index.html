			<br /><br />This is Molly.<br /><br /> Molly was my family's Black Lab mix. She passed away from Lymphoma in May 2014.<br /><br />
			She was a major part of my family, from growing up with my younger brother and I, she also was "office manager" to my dad who works from home, to keeping my mom company on her days off.<br /><br />
			She also was insanely smart and even though she couldn't tell time, she knew when her people, her family, would be home. She also was having trouble with her hips as well but she never cried or made any sort of noise to let us know that she was in pain.
			She was just happy to be with her people and have her people all around her at all times.<br /><br /> She was SOME DOG and I wanted to find a way to help get through my grief while still remembering her.<br/><br />
			The purpose of this website is to provide to former pet owners that it's okay to feel sad that such a major part of your life is gone but we know that our pets wouldn't want us to be sad, if they were here they would be doing everything in their power to make us feel better.<br/><br />
			Feel free to take advantage of our stories and photo gallery page! I'm looking forward to seeing all these heartwarming stories of your beloved pet.<br/><br />
			This website can also be of use to new pet owners as well from tips, articles, and videos on picking out the right pet to training said pet or finding the pet that is just right for you through the link to our Humane Society website.<br/><br />
			I hope this helps in some way to new and veteran owners, and to those that are ready to move on.

			<p id="last">Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant tumors to occur in dogs. The cause is genetic, but there are also suspected environmental factors involved,[1] including in one study an increased risk with the use of the herbicide 2,4-D. This risk was not confirmed in another study.<br /><br />
			Breeds that are commonly affected include Boxer, Scottish Terrier, Basset Hound, Airedale Terrier, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Poodle, St. Bernard, Bulldog, Beagle, Rottweiler and Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever is especially susceptible to developing lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1:8<br /><br />
