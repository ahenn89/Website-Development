			Erins Edge Labradors has specialized in breeding Chocolate Labradors for 
			the field as well as for family hunting companions since 1980, raising 5-7 litters a year.

					<p>We often breed Field Champion Blacks to Chocolate females 
					for diversity, and to intensify the Chocolate lines, and occasionally 
					we produce Yellows that are are usually from Black titled males. 
					My females must be intelligent working dogs with an excellent pedigree
					and temperament, OFA Excellent or Good hips, OFA normal elbows, CERF 
					clear eyes, good bone and conformation, great drive and desire.</p>

					<p>The 
					parents of these females and my studs must also have the same health 
					clearances, have been proven not to produce serious genetic problems, 
					and live long and healthy lives without medication. All breedings are 
					guaranteed to produce pups that are unaffected for EIC and CNM, and as 
					new DNA tests come out, my dogs will be tested and bred appropriately.</p>
					
					<p>I do not believe eliminating all carriers is in the best interest of any
					Breed, so I look for the best match for Health, Performance, and Diversity
					of the Labrador breed. My breeding program has focused on breeding to 
					talented, trainable, and good looking field studs that resemble the classic
					Labrador look as much as possible.</p>

					<p> Roadhouse Gusto, OFA Excellent, was my own Qualified All Age senior stud, 
					a dark chocolate who was a talented marker, stylish and dynamic...a pleasure to run. 
					I consider him my foundation sire not only because he was my first dog to QAA, but 
					he showed me we could run Opens. His loyalty, love, and devotion were truly 
					exceptional; he was my heart dog and best Bud ever. His father was 1992 NAFC/FC 
					Gusto's Last Control and his littermate sister was 1998 NAFC/FC Hattie McBunn who
					was also the 1998 High Point Amateur Female with multiple Doubleheader Wins.</p>
					
					<p>Hattie's breeding with LeanMac produced multiple 7 FC and one of the strongest 
					competitive lines in FT ever. Erins Edge Goose Ya Big Studd, MH OFA Excellent 
					is the son of FC/AFC/CFC/CAFC Barracuda Blue, MH, the first  dog in AKC history 
					with all five titles and amateur trained, and frozen semen is still available.
					Erin's Edge Lean Machine SH (Rico), was my Black Stud from 2X NAFC/FC 2X CNAFC 
					Ebonstar LeanMac who has produced over 155 FC, the #1 producer in FT history, 
					and FC/AFC Gator Pts Sweet Potato Pie (the first FC/AFC Chocolate female in AKC 
					history) who passed yellow and chocolate.</p>

					<p>The majority of my bitch line goes back 
					to Hard Driving Abigail, one of my foundation bitches, was 83 pounds, had great 
					a great nose, drive, and desire, a distinct personality, and a long life free of 
					any medications with the other being Mallard Lake Lady Magnum QAA OFA Excellent,
					who was for a brief time the only breedable QAA Chocolate female and she fostered 
					all my puppies.</p>
					
					<p>The combination of Roady and Maggie's lines along with GRHRCH 
					Gator Pt's Magnum Gentle Ben MH,QAA, at one time #3 HRC producer of titled dogs, 
					a wonderful dog titled in 3 venues AKC FT, AKC HT, and HRC grand champion are 
					in  Erin's Edge Double Magnum Ben SH, chocolate, OFA Excellent, sires birdy 
					hunting and family companions with that Classic Labrador Look. I also have 
					another line of blacks originating in Alaska and Canada out of AFC Westwind's 
					Iron Fist his great grandson Erin's Edge Bada Boom QAA (Rizzo) who is Black from 
					FC/AFC Candlewoods Rulin the Roost, Rooster (LeanMac and 3X NFC Lottie's Sister Bebe)
					and Katy, my FC/AFC Webshire Honest Abe x AFC Westwind Iron Fist line.  His brother 
					Rip, FC Premiers Riptide received his FC on 5-10-09, my first bred FC. My young black
					stud is Erins Edge Roadhouse Ride Em QAA is a combination of Rooster lines and Abe 
					Lines (FC Rip and Rizzo's sister) bred using frozen semen from Roady. He is 
					available for stud, a chocolate factored black.</p>

					<p>New up and coming Chocolate 
					stud Merc, Erin's Edge We Will Rock You, will bring in the genes of NFC/NAFC
					Candlewoods Supertanker and 3XNFC/AFC Candlewoods Tanks a Lot. The newest puppy 
					will arrive in June, 2014, a Chocolate Factored Black by FC/AFC Merlyn IV 
					(FC Fargo II x FC Case Hardened Colors)  FC at 3 yrs - Won Derby/Qual same 
					trial - 35 derby points and currently has 78.5 Open AA points - Qualified 
					for multiple Nationals. Dam: Working Class Zoe of Zanzibar MH, QAA (FC-AFC Way

					derby dog "Ammo") . Merc and the puppy will be trained by Tim Springer of
