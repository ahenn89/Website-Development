					<font color="#6495ED"><p><strong>All Pups born and raised on Erin's Edge's 
					Premises were under my control, Licensed by the State of Wisconsin,
					License number 267976-DS. Inspected and Approved initially August 26th, 2011

					<p>You have a week to get your deposit in but you <font color="#6495ED"><strong>
					MUST commit on the phone or email </strong></font>(which I log) that you are
					mailing a deposit to hold your place, otherwise I go by day postmarked.</p>
					
					<p><font color="#6495ED"><strong>Saying you will get back to me does not hold 
					a pick place!</strong></font></p> 
					
					<p>All my pregnant and nursing Females are fed
					<font color="#6495ED">Farmina</font> food made in Italy and I will be feeding 
					<font color="#6495ED">Fromms Gold</font>foods,<font color="#6495ED">American 
					Natural Premium </font>which is made by <font color="#6495ED">Fromms</font>, 
					or <font color="#6495ED">Farmina</font> to the rest of the dogs. The pups will receive
					<font color="#6495ED">Fromms Large Breed Gold Puppy</font> All of these 
					manufacturers guarantee to not use Chinese Ingredients. 
					Italian standards are much higher than US and <font color="#6495ED">Fromms</font> 
					is made in Wisconsin. <font color="#6495ED">Dams will also be supplemented with
					high DHA fish oil or Tuna oil. Now with the new dog food delivery websites you

					<font color="#6495ED"><strong>All pups will be sold with a Limited Registration* see below</strong></font>
				</div>
					
					<p>*I prefer to sell to homes that do not intend to breed. <font color="#6495ED"><strong>I rarely will
					make an exception on an individual basis with people I know or who have a history on Entry Express 
					AND are Approved.</strong></font> Breeding has become very complicated with EIC testing; 
					therefore, <font color="#6495ED"><strong>all pups will be sold with a Limited Registration.</strong></font></p>
					
					<p>This means you can not breed them.  You may have it changed to Full Registration once the dog is 2 
					years old and has successfully passed all its health certifications. The health certifications are 
					OFA hips and elbows, Eye Certification done by a licensed Ophthalmologist, and DNA testing for EIC 
					and CNM if needed. You must also pay me an additional $200. <font color="#6495ED">The dog must have
					attained a field title of at least SH.</font> Since I sell on Limited Registration,  I do not do EIC 
					testing on puppies. If you want EIC testing on pups prior to purchase you are welcome to pay for 
					the testing.
					</p>
					
					<p> *With Limited registration you may still enter any AKC event except the conformation show ring:
					that means obedience, agility, hunt test etc. If the puppy would be CNM and EIC Clear, and I know you 
					or you can demonstrate responsible breeding practices, I may issue a full registration after all the 
					health certs are done (Hip OFA, & Elbows and Eye CERF) and $200 and a title of at least Senior hunter.</p>
