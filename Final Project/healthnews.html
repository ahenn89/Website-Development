					<p>Zink. From Kita and Goose DOB 4-26-00 First hunting season.</p>
					
					<p> I thought I would give you an update on Zink now that hunting season is about over.
					He did a great job and retrieved over 50 ducks. He gets very intense when I blow a call 
					and loves to keep an eye in the sky. He minds very well in and out of the boat and is a 
					joy to take hunting. I have had many people compliment me on his demeanor and are 
					surprised to find out how young he is. I would like to get him "finished" in terms 
					of training (blind retrieves, hand signals,etc.) and would like to send him away during 
					late spring -early summer so I could have him back in the early fall (Sept.) for the 
					beginning of hunting season. He is quite intelligent so I know it won't take much and 
					with us having an acre pond right behind our house it is quite easy to work with him daily.
					Thanks again for breeding a great dog and companion. The kids love him a bunch and he 
					enjoys playing with them!</p>
					
					<p>2001 Update He is very obedient and well mannered and does a wonderful job in the 
					field. He did a great job this fall despite it being a very tough year of duck and 
					goose hunting. He even made a trip with us to Arkansas. He continues to learn more 
					everyday and looks forward to this fall as much as I do! He is very enjoyable to have 
					around.</p>

					<p>Jacy/Roady at 7 months, sent on a cold April 1st with ice.</p>
					
					<p>Just thought you would like to know how Mocha is doing. We spoil her pretty good 
					and we love her. She is retrieving hard, even blind and in the water. Still working
					with her every day. We had her out swimming yesterday for the first time and she is
					definitely a water dog. I am attaching a few pictures for you. Thanks for the great 
					pup.</p>

					<p>Halle, Jacy/Roady</p>
					
					<p>9/01Well Halle passed her first Juniors!</p>
					
					<p> Halle did just great! She drove deep on her first mark, but she worked her way back 
					( and after 55 birds were dropped before hers, I'd say it was great work. There were 84 
					dogs ran in one stake!) The bird was still alive once she did retrieve it, and she seemed 
					a little leery of it's flapping, she spit it out at my feet and at first didn't want to
					pick it up. (we'll be working on that) But, she just nailed every mark after that. She 
					is absolutely great on her water marks. She could've had a little cheating situation on 
					her third, but didn't, just went straight out and straight back. She had a very long land
					into water mark for her fourth bird and once she got to the water she was half way to the 
					bird before she hit! She was so pumped! She just got better after each one.</p>
					
					<p>HALLE GOT HER JUNIOR TITLE!!!!</p>
					<p>Halle passed 5 in a row. Kim started Halle's training and sent her to Kathy Swab.
					Halle impressed the judges wherever she went, with her drive and desire, especially 
					in the water. Kim will be running SH next year.</p>

					<p>Sadie, Aggie/Goose</p>
					
					<p>Sadie is a great addition to our family. She is very laid back, what you might call a real
					couch potato, but definitely a pistol when it comes to retrieving. She has excellent marking 
					abilities for a young dog. And LOVES retrieving in water.Thanks for another great dog! Kim Update 
					6/02. Sadie passed her 1st Junior with a yipee but will stay in training for field trials. 
					See 2003 new pics</p>

					<p>Anna, Roady/Jacy puppy from August 2000, got her first started pass saturday at Kelly Farms, 
					Minnesota, the second youngest dog to do so. I wanted to give you the news and tell you how 
					happy I've been with this dog. She's always been healthy, a fast learner, and very affectionate. 
					I need to do alot more work with her, of course, but she appears to have a bright future. I couldn't 
					ask for a more enthusiastic dog, in fact, my immediate concern with her training now is to get her 
					to settle down a bit and focus more on hand delivery, obedience, ect. Her marking is exeptional. 
					Update 2002: She's a hunting and retrieving fanatic in the field, yet very mild mannered in the house. 
					This year of hunting she has really started coming into her own. We hunted and flushed well over 
					100 birds and somewhere in the neighbourhood of 40-50 were shot over her this fall. She gets the big
					picture and has become a great asset to my hunting team. I look forward to many more productive
					years with her.</p>

					<p>Sydney, Roady/Jacy. We wanted to send you a picture of Sydney. She's a pup from Roady & Jacy and 
					is about 8 months in this picture. We've been so happy with her. She's weighing in at close to 80 lbs! 
					Her favorite thing to do is go swimming. If there is water around, Sydney's in it. She's been pheasant 
					hunting and she flushed, but wasn't sure what to do after that! That's ok, now we know what to work 
					on this summer. We want to thank you for the great pup and we're looking forward to getting a puppy
					for Sydney!</p>

					<p>Prime Time Tucker, Jacy/Goose,</p>
					
					<p>Tucker is beautiful, intelligent and has a wonderful personality. He never bit or chewed and house 
					trained very quickly. He has been excellent with children and babies around the neighborhood. Everybody 
					loves Tucker. We are grateful to have such a special addition to our family, and we're glad we chose 
					Erins Edge for our pup.</p>

					<img  src="images/news2000_2001/buster1_30.jpg" />
					
					<p>Buster, Maggie /Cash at 3 months old.</p>
					
					<p>I took Buster to a hunt test today to see what go's on at them. We had a ball but the fun part came 
					at the end. Thats when they had a call for all puppies up front the next thing I knew Buster and I were 
					standing with about 15 other guys with there puppies. Not sure what was going to happen we slipped to 
					the middle of the line to watch a couple first. When it came our turn the man asked bumper or duck I 
					choose bumper since Buster has never retrieved a duck. He called us to the line I got down to hold buster
					then a man about 30 yards away starts a hootin and wavin his arms Busters ears perked up his tail started
					going then the guy threw the bumper. Buster ran after that bumper like never before did a flip trying to 
					pick it up that got a chuckle from everybody and thats when Buster knew everybody was watching him. He 
					looked around a little and ran back with the bumper happy as could be. The guy said one more so we did 
					it again only this time when he brought back the bumper he pranced all the way back everybody laughed and 
					cheered him on. Then the guy says we got to try a duck so we get ready he starts a hootin and wavin and t
					hrows the duck. Buster takes off but when he gets there he sniffs a little then looks at me I yell fetch 
					he trys to pick it up he cant get a hold of it he looks back again i yell fetch it up again he gos back to
					trying again but cant get it picked up so then he starts dragging back to me backwards everybody cheered 
					him on he loved it! So Buster got his first ribbon and made us proud</p>
					
					<p>He has been doing great with training he starts running hunt tests in 3 weeks. last weekend he came home
					for a vist and is still the perfect house dog. even after 2 mo. living outside with the trainer. Update 6/02.
					Well its been a couple weeks ago now but Buster got his HR title. The last weekend he was just smokin the test's.
					He came home for the summer for some R&R but we are still going to train on weekends with the trainer, Buster 
					just loves to work I dont think he could stand stopping cold turkey.</p>
