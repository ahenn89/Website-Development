					<font color="#6495ED"><p><strong>Erins Edge Labradors has specialized in breeding Chocolate 
					Labradors for the field as well as for family hunting companions
					since 1980, raising 5-7 litters a year.</strong></font> We often breed Field Champion
					Blacks to Chocolate females for diversity, and to intensify the Chocolate
					lines, and occasionally we produce Yellows that are are usually from Black 
					titled males. My females must be intelligent working dogs with an excellent
					pedigree and temperament, OFA Excellent or Good hips, OFA normal elbows, 
					CERF clear eyes, good bone and conformation, great drive and desire. 
					The parents of these females and my studs must also have the same health 
					clearances, have been proven not to produce serious genetic problems, and 
					live long and healthy lives without medication. <font color="#6495ED"><strong>All breedings are guaranteed 
					to produce pups that are unaffected for EIC and CNM, and as new DNA tests 
					come out, my dogs will be tested and bred appropriately.</strong></font></p> 
					
					<p>I do not believe eliminating all carriers is in the best interest of any Breed, so I look 
					for the best match for Health, Performance, and Diversity of the Labrador 
					breed. My breeding program has focused on breeding to talented, trainable,
					and good looking field studs that resemble the classic Labrador look as much as possible.
					I offer a real written guarantee with replacement after you neuter or spay your dog, and
					I do not require you return the dog to me, which I consider a non-guarantee. Pups 
					receive complete Veterinary health checks with a report card, are microchipped,
					dew claws are removed, they are dewormed multiple times, and are well socialized and 
					exposed to feathers. Pups are raised completely inside my home and have a 
					play area outside during the day. At stud are Titled and DNA profiled 
					Chocolates and that are CNM, EIC, and PRA clear. I look for homes where 
					dogs live in the house and are part of the family. I sell on Limited 
					Registration, and if buyers want to breed, the Registration can be converted
					to Full Registration by obtaining all the health certs and a thorough understanding of breeding.
					<font color="#6495ED"><strong>I have been active as a Field Trial handler, have judged AKC Licensed Field Trials for over
					20 years, and I also compete in AKC Hunt Tests.</strong></font> Visit my online store on my website with 
					over 200 natural and innovative products for your dog including custom made all natural
					healthy treats, probiotics, hypo-allergenic treats, Holistic and Herbal remedies, supplements,
					Labrador gifts, toys, and other unique dog products.</p>
					
				<div class=border></div>
					
					<p>I slowly incorporated new individuals from all black and chocolate field 
					champion lines that had proven to be genetically healthy and showed natural
					talent. I do not deviate from my lines unless I know the health background 
					of the dogs, and I have the great-great granddaughter of foundation bitch 
					so I know my lines. I do not lease females to breed or buy older females 
					just to breed but breed only my own female lines. I also had several Yellows 
					from a line I bought from a friend that knows his lines. My observation has 
					been that breeding to show or Champion lines that have not produced working 
					dogs, dramatically lowers the drive, desire, and intelligence in the pups, 
					so my breeding program has focused on breeding to talented, trainable, and 
					good looking field studs that resemble the classic Labrador look as much as 
					possible, and occasionally bench/field crosses where the lines have produced
					working dogs that have at least titled as Master Hunters.</p> 
					
					<p>Breeding is more than putting two dogs together. Some Breeders advertise they are trying to
					"Better the Breed", whatever that means. I am constantly trying to 
					"Improve my own Lines" so they look and hunt like a Classic Labrador. 
					Although I enthusiastically support any puppy owner that competes my dogs,
					<font color="#6495ED"><strong>I am more interested in the best possible home for my pups,</strong></font>
					rather than selling to competition homes only. <font color="#6495ED"><strong>I am not 
					interested in selling to parties that resell the dogs either.</strong></font>
					Working homes are preferred and most of my pups are in hunting 
					or hunt test homes, but they also do obedience, agility, therapy dogs, search and
					rescue, become Canine Good Citizens and Therapy Dogs, and are also beloved Family
					Companions. I strive for dogs that have a great desire for hunting, but after the
					puppy stage, are able to relax in the house. Please be aware that field pups and
					dogs need a good run everyday and do not make good couch potato dogs without 
					some exercise, and this should not be confused with being hyper.</p>
					
					<p>My dogs live long, healthy lives; however, I use natural topical insecticides, don't chemically 
					treat my lawn, and feed a high quality premium food along with my antioxidant treats, 
					fish oil, Fido-Vite, and probiotics for their whole lives. No one can guarantee that 
					a dog will be free from hereditary disorders but I have researched the pedigrees, 
					health clearances, and consulted with many other breeders before choosing dogs for 
					my breeding program.  Pups will be guaranteed to be not affected for CNM and EIC
					(Exercise Induced Collapse). Pups are raised in my great room or a whelping room 
					in my house, and weather permitting, have outside outings everyday.</p> 
					
					<p>Puppies come with a puppy care packet with a written hip and eye guarantee, 1st set of vaccinations,
					dewormed 3X, vet checked, dewclaws removed, microchipped, well socialized and exposed 
					to feathers. <font color="#6495ED"><strong>Deposits($200) are non-refundable</strong></font>and can be made
					by a check or through Paypal using your credit card for $210 or using Paypal for final 
					payment there is a $40 surcharge.  Balances must be paid in cash (preferred) or a 
					check 2 weeks prior to puppy pick-up. My preference is a check for a deposit and 
					cash for the balance plus sales tax. In the event the litter or sex is not born, the 
					deposit may be moved to another or future litter within 2 years.</p> 
					
					<p>Pedigrees are available on the litter page along with pictures. 
					Follow the pups on the Nursery Page. Pups are fed Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy. 
					There is not a lot of hype on this website, but there are a lot of happy Erin's 
					Edge puppy owners. Visit the<a href="news.html">NEWS</a> pages and look at some of my pups, 
					their families and stories year by year.<font color="#6495ED"><strong> My kennel has been inspected by the AKC 
					four times and has always passed inspection with no deficiencies and by the State 
					of Wisconsin twice with no deficiencies.</strong></font></p><br />
