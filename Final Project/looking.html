			<h2>Looking for a PUPPY</h2>
			</div>

				<div class=main_article>
				
					<p>1. Make sure parents and individuals have OFA numbers for Hips AND Elbows, 
					as elbows are starting to be a problem in field dogs. You can verify these 
					numbers online at www.offa.org and now study the parents, grandparents, siblings 
					and offspring. Hips should be done for a number of generations, but the parents
					may only have Elbow numbers. If there is no OFA number for Hips recorded, then 
					the dog probably does not have one. If you are told the dog is "Prelimed", ask 
					for a copy of the report signed by the vet on his official office form. If there
					is no report, I would question the x-ray.  Please verufy on OFA because there are 
					blatant lies on websites of many breeders</p>
					
					<p>2. CNM (Centronuclear Myopathy-a muscular myopathy) and EIC (Exercise Induced 
					Collapse) are devastating inherited diseases for Labradors. The CNM DNA test is 
					available and we send swabs to France for the test. EIC testing has become available
					in August 2008 at the University of Minnesota and a vet must obtain the same. These 
					tests are not inexpensive but responsible breeders perform them. If one parent is clear
					in the breeding, the same for both conditions, the puppies will be normal and healthy 
					but may be a carrier. If a carrier puppy is bred to another carrier puppy, 25% of the 
					puppies in that litter can be affected. This is why many breeders are issuing Limited 
					Registrations so these diseases are tested for before breeding. If the breeder has no 
					idea what these conditions are move on or you could buy an affected puppy. The aim of 
					this testing is not to produce an affected pup. An affected CNM puppy will become evident 
					by 4-6 months. The puppy will want to retrieve but will fall over and his back leg muscles
					will not look right.  An affected EIC puppy may befome evident between 6 months and 3 years.
					The usual way it presents is during excitement (throwing bumpers, pheasant hunting) or stress,
					the back legs will give out on the dog but he will be awake and still want to go.  In about 
					20 minutes he will recover and be normal. Some of these dogs can be hunted when the owners 
					learn to recognize the attack coming on but some can die if it goes too far or drown if they 
					are in water. Many breeders send the EIC result to OFA. If they do not, a  breeder should be 
					able to issue you a copy of the EIC results from U of M. If you request a copy and the breeder
					doesn't send it MOVE ON. Here is a fact that came to my attention, if an EIC result is advertised
					with a number, verify it on the OFA website. Carriers and Clears get a number if sent into 
					OFA-Affecteds do not. The number will have CAR at the end of the number if a carrier. The CAR
					could be left off and appear to be Clear. Verify it on the OFA website.</p>
					
					<p>Erin's Edge will not produce EIC or CNM affected pups, but pups will not be tested to be 
					clear or carriers. Buyers that are interested in breeding must test for hips, elbows, eyes, 
					and EIC before breeding and all EIC carriers must be bred to clears only!. Erin's Edge does 
					not breed to CNM carriers so pups will be clear by parentage. If the litter you are looking 
					at does not have one EIC clear parent (Exercise Induced Collapse) or if the breeder doesn't 
					even know what EIC even is, you risk getting a puppy that will collapse during hunting or even
					when excited.</p> 
					
					<p>3. Make sure parents eyes are CERFed if you want to breed or buy a puppy. Puppies that come 
					from parents that are not CERFed can become blind. CERF numbers can also be verified online 
					at http://www.vmdb.org/cerf2.html. A veterinarian can't "look" at the eyes or hips and say 
					they are ok. Hips and Elbows MUST be xrayed and eyes must be looked at by a board certified 
					canine Ophthalmologist. Most breeders get certificates from the ACVO vet that the pups eyes 
					are clear so the new owner will repeat the exam before breeding to get a CERF number.</p>
					
					<p>4. Ask for the written guarantee, read it and understand it BEFORE YOU BUY. Many breeders 
					will replace a pup only if you euthanize it or return it to them. Some breeders only have 
					occasional pups so ask them what they will do if they don't have any pups for replacements 
					to honor the guarantee. Some breeders will return part of your money. Some breeders do not 
					guarantee against mild dysplasia. Severe dysplasia is uncommon, although not rare, by 2 years,
					but mild dysplasia is more common. Make sure the guarantee covers all dysplasia for 26 months.</p>
					
					<p>5. PRA (progressive blindness) is usually not apparent by ACVO exam until 3-5 years or more 
					and is rare in field dogs and more common in bench dogs. A guarantee against PRA until 2 years 
					is kind of a non-guarantee. Retinal dysplasia is more common in field dogs and can be ruled out
					at 6 weeks. PUPPY folds that disappear (as opposed to true retinal folds) have finally been proven
					to not cause hereditary retinal dysplasia. Cataracts can be inherited or acquired (as from trauma).
					Only juvenile and inherited cataracts are a concern for breeding.</p>
					
					<p>6. A good field pedigree has 10-14 FC's in a 4 generation pedigree, has FC's on all sides of the 
					pedigree, and titled dogs in the 1st and 2nd generations. An NFC or NAFC is the top dog that year at 
					the National Open or Amateur. A "C" prefix, such CFC denotes a Canadian FC. A CH is a show or 
					conformation champion and is not a field championship. Hunt test titles are not championships as 
					the dogs are graded against a standard and do not compete against each other, but they are a good 
					measure of ability and show the dog is trainable if a SH or MH is accomplished. The Derby is a stake
					for dogs under the age of 2 that awards points and not titles, although Derby Champ for the year is 
					a great accomplishment. See the WRC library for more title definitions. Check with the AKC website 
					for agility and obedience titles.</p>
					
					<p>7. Linebreeding in a pedigree will intensify the characteristics of that dog repeated in the 
					pedigree. Linebreeding is not bad, but the breeder must have knowledge about the health and temperament 
					of the dog and know if it is "clean" for genetic defects that could compromise the quality of life of 
					the offspring. Doubling up on genes can make a uniform litter, but it can also be disaster if unwanted 
					recessives are doubled up. NO dog is free of genetic defects, and each dog probably carries an estimated
					7-10 recessive genes that when combined, can cause minor to severe defects. Defects passed by breeding to 
					known carriers usually shows up in 2 to 3 generations when novice and BYB breeders start putting dogs together 
					without knowing the history of dogs in the pedigree.</p>
					
				<div class=border></div>
				
				<img src="images/blue135wk2.jpg" />
					
					<p>8. A Limited registration allows you to compete in any AKC event, other than conformation, such as hunt 
					test, flyball, obedience, agility, CGC, etc. You may NOT breed with a limited registration. The breeder is 
					the only person that can convert a Limited to a Full registration BEFORE the dog is bred. If you are taking 
					a limited registration on one of my pups, I require the $50-$100 difference in buying price plus OFA and CERF
					to be performed. If your dog is bred with a limited registration I may not agree to convert the limited 
					registration to full.</p>
					
					<p>9. Having both parents on the premises should not be an important criteria for choosing a puppy. The use
					of outside stud dogs is often necessary to better a breeding program. Many of my own females live with their 
					own family and when they are done nursing they go home.</p> 
					
					<p>10. Although AKC papers are no indication of the quality of the puppy, avoid other US registries. As AKC 
					has required DNA on frequent sires and raised fees, new registries have been popping up with no requirements 
					other than paying a fee to register even a mixed breed dog.</p>

					<p>11. If you are told the parents eagerly fetch a tennis ball or a retriever trainer dummy, that is not 
					indicative of hunting instinct, birdiness, or the ability to be trained for field competition. If someone 
					tells you their lines have NO genetic defects move on. It's impossible. Every dog carries multiple recessive 
					genes that carry genetic defects. As a breeder I look on the OFA website and analyze the pedigrees and OFA 
					ratings but hip dysplasia is a polygenic defect which means multiple genes are involved with a threshold affect.
					That;s why OFA excellent to OFA excellent can produce a dysplastic pup, and that's why you need a breeder that 
					stands behind their hip guarantee. We can't always anticipate how the genes will line up and maybe the pair will
					be a bad nick and shouldn't be repeated.</p> 
					
					<p>12. Purchasing a puppy should be a family decision and not done on impulse. The adults should BOTH want the
					puppy and participate in its training. This means if Dad wants a pup and Mom is overwhelmed with children or 
					babies, wait unless Dad will accept full responsibility for the care of the puppy. The puppy should be prepared 
					for, and cared for properly. The purchase price of the puppy can end up being very small compared to veterinary 
					bills that accumulate from buying on impulse from a mall store, newspaper, or back yard breeder. Most reputable 
					breeders frown on Christmas pups as gifts because many end up in shelters and rescue when the work starts in 
					raising a puppy. Also, Christmas pups suffer because there is too much commotion in the house at that time and 
					going to their new homes may be the most stressful time in their lives. Plan for your dog and look for the best 
					dog to suit your needs rather than making a quick decision, because that dog becomes your responsibility for the 
					next 10-15 years.</p>
					
					<p>13. Please be realistic about getting a puppy if you have small children. Although you may think they are ready 
					for responsible pet ownership, if they move quickly, erratically, scream a lot, and suddenly wake the puppy from a 
					nap they may scare the puppy and cause behavior problems. Please wait until your children are more mature. Older 
					children and their friends should be forbidden to tease the dog and be taught to leave him alone when he is in his 
					crate and wants a time-out. Supervision may be necessary with visiting children. Even a puppy with a good temperament 
					has limitations with misbehaving children. Don't come and expect small children to pick out your puppy. This is an 
					adult decision.</p>
					
					<p>14. Field, Show, British, English, American. It gets real confusing. Basically, there is a huge split between 
					field Labs and show Labs on how they look and function. At one time, prior to the late 60's, field and show dogs
					looked similar and British field and show Labs looked similar. The first Labradors in Newfoundland were described 
					as similar to our field Labs today. Form follows Function. The show Labs changed dramatically in the late 1960's 
					when Sandylands Labradors from England were brought over and bred, and subsequently U.K. show judges were brought 
					over to judge them. BIS CH Shamrock Acres Light Brigade (Briggs) had 12 BIS wins. Since the introduction of the 
					Sandylands Mark & Midas to the scene, Labs are hard pressed to even get a group placement. Brigg's grandfather was
					Ch. Whygin Poppitt whose grandson 1966,1969 NFC Whygin Cork's Coot sired FC/AFC Trumarc's Raider from which the top 
					field Labradors of all time come from, Honcho, Zip Code, Raiders Piper Cub etc. Show people claim the dogs follow the
					standard but even to the casual observer, they are overdone and heavy. They are referred to as English Labs, or English
					type Labs. British Labs are field Labradors from the U.K. American Labs originally descended from British Labs, but
					have been in the U.S. for many years. Field trials are much different in the U.K. than here and our field dogs have 
					evolved to highly intellectual, magnificent athletes.</p>
					
					<p>15.  I often hear people say "they are just looking for a pet and not a show dog" so they don't want to spend much.
					My advice then is look into a rescue dog. The same care and medical certifications go into a dog purchased for competition 
					or a pet. The money you spend on a pet with a reputable breeder will pay off with a healthier dog and fewer vet bills. 
					Although some people luck out with a nice pet from a backyard breeder, remember, many don't and look for a reputable breeder 
					next time. People selling inferior stock rely on impulse purchases. You may have your dog for 10-15 years, and saving a few
					hundred dollars on the purchase price may look like nothing over the course of the dogs' life.</p>
					
					<p>16.  If a website has no names or addresses there is a reason they don't want to be found. If the only contact information
					is an email, especially yahoo or hotmail, I would be wary. A good breeder wants to showcase their dogs and not hide. Also, 
					beware of the breeder that promises too much, lets pups go before 7 weeks, does not do vet checks or vaccinations, feeds a 
					cheap food, or makes you sign a contract to feed a certain food. (if you don't feed it and have problems they won't honor 
					their guarantee.)</p>
					
					<p>17.  The Internet has useful information, but just because it's on the Internet doesn't make it true. Many long time 
					breeders will answer questions, but they won't answer 25 question lists taken off internet sites. Also, many long time 
					breeders will not give out names of people as references because they get many calls for pups and have to protect the 
					privacy of their clients. Remember, every puppy mill can provide names which will give raving references about their pups 
					but they may be friends and relatives. The best reference is another breeder's recommendation or a vet that sees the breeders 
					puppies for health exams.</p>
					
					<p>18.  The problem with concentrating on the dynamics of the litter looking for aggression and shyness is that the puppy 
					may change once he leaves the litter and are on their own. Buy from a breeder that watches the pups, but beware of one 
					that thinks they can form a complete personality analysis on a 7 week old puppy because personalities change and they don't
					know from inexperience. Pick the litter and breeder then take some feathers along. Be aware that puppies play hard, sleep 
					hard, and sleep in the midday when it is warm. If they are all acting like duds, go with the breeder recommendation. Often,
					they are very close and then stick your hand in rule works well.</p>
					
				<div class=border></div>
				<img src="images/flashtiger7wk.jpg" /> 
				
					<p>19. " I am often asked if the puppy will be hyper, and I then ask are your children hyper? If they say yes, I then tell 
					them that their dog will be hyper too. I remind them that pups are like their children - they come to live with you, you 
					don't go to live with them and they must obey the house rules." (quoted from Cleo Watson, long time breeder). If your children
					do not listen to you it is a reflection on your parenting skills and possibly your ability to raise a puppy properly.</p>
					
					<p>20. Number one question from people is size. How big are the parents? What size will the pup be? The genetic make-up of 
					a dog is also influenced by genetics of the dog behind the parents. Would you expect 10 children born of the same parents to
					be exactly the same in height and body? Can you predict the outcome of a 6'4" man and a 5'2" woman accurately? Well, neither
					can breeders. We can guess but I have seen it all: a smaller sire producing a small pup that grows into a pup 25# bigger 
					than the sire; a repeat breeding having smaller adult dogs in the 2nd breeding, pups from smaller parents growing up to be 
					large adults. All we can do is take an educated guess. You can design the exact car you want but you can't design a dog so 
					please don't ask the breeder to find your designer dog as far as looks and personality. It would be nice but we don't have 
					crystal balls.</p>
					
					<p>21. Colors-especially breeders that breed for White Labs, Silver Labs, Red or Fox Red Labs, Cream, Butterscotch or 
					whatever, be very careful as Labs bred only for a particular color probably have glaring health or temperament problems. 
					If you are looking for one if these colors, buy from a breeder that occadionally has them but breeds for the whole dog. 
					This also can include Pointing Labs, Miniature Labs, or Giant Labs over 100#.</p>
				
					<p>22. Don't expect your field Lab puppy to be laid back and trained out of the box. You must set aside time to let them 
					run and train them to be good citizens. If you come home from work and just want to eat and veg out in front of the TV, 
					don't get a Lab. Excerpt from the article "The most misunderstood dogs in America" By Steve Dale. http://usaweekend.com/06_issues/061105/061105animalsmart.html 
					A look at five breeds often left abandoned. Their worst offense? Their human owners never should have bought them. 
					For some dogs, their only crimes are unrealistic expectations. As a result, they're misunderstood, and some are downright 
					hated. Some breeds have such a bad rep that they need a press agent. Others have such idealistic "Lassie" images that 
					it's nearly impossible to live up to them. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 6 million to 8 million 
					dogs and cats are relinquished to shelters annually, and about half of those are euthanized. We don't know which breeds
					are relinquished most often, but when I asked four dog experts which five breeds they think are most often abandoned, their 
					picks were unanimous and mirrored my own hunches. "My dream is that people would choose the right dog to match their lifestyles," 
					says Ian Dunbar, founder of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers. "Then, once you have that dog, understand what you're dealing 
					with," adds Ledy VanKavage, senior director at the ASPCA. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen enough, and it leads to this list.</p>
					
					<p>Labradors (and Lab mixes). People expect Labs to be perfectly trained, like the service Labs who team with the visually or 
					physically impaired. "Here's the reality: They were bred to work under difficult conditions and have the drive to swim through 
					ice to get that bird," says Patricia McConnell, author of "For the Love of a Dog: Understanding Emotion in You and Your Best 
					Friend." That's not to say with training and time they don't settle down, but they're not the instant soup people expect. 
					"The expectations are so high, it's difficult to live up to," VanKavage says. "They're great dogs for a fairly active family, 
					but not for elderly Aunt Tilda," Bradley adds. "And because Labs are large, they can easily learn to drag Aunt Tilda down the 
					street." Golden retrievers can have the same problems.</p>
					
					<p>References: The NEWS pages are comprised of unsolicited pictures and emails from puppy owners which I prefer than listing 
					puppy references and contact information on the Internet. I can provide professional references, such as other breeders, 
					trainers, and veterinarians, which I feel are more meaningful, and can provide puppy references if absolutely necessary. 
					Remember, puppy references can often be friends and relatives and of course they will be happy with their pups, but it's 
					the breeder peer groups that tell the real story.</p>
